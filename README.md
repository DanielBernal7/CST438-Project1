Project 01 Retrospective and overview

Github Repo: https://github.com/DanielBernal7/CST438-Project1 

## Overview
A React Native application that allows users to explore Pokémon using the PokeAPI. Users can search for Pokémon, view detailed information about specific Pokémon, including their stats and abilities. This app utilizes SQLite for local data storage and authentication.   
##Introduction
* How was communication managed
Communication was done either through slack or after class 
* How many stories/issues were initially considered
We started out with 12 issues
* How many stories/issues were completed
We completed
During the process we mainly communicated through slack while working on our respective issues. After class we would discuss the strategy going forward, and how each of us would develop the app.

* What was your role / which stories did you work on
I worked mainly with implementing the user database and sign up process in our app. Basically Handling how users are taken in and stored for future sessions.
*What was the biggest challenge? 
Personally the biggest challenge was trying to get the user database setup
* Why was it a challenge?
* I think it was a mix of both being new to react native and figuring out how it works, as well as not having much experience with setting up and working with databases in the past. Simply trial and error of figuring out what does what. The emulator being buggy most of the time did not help at all too.
* How was the challenge addressed?
Looked up react native documentation and peers for assistance.
* Favorite / most interesting part of this project
Getting the database to properly work when adding and storing users and displaying them in the test page.
* If you could do it over, what would you change?
Making the pages I worked on more visually appealing.
*What is the most valuable thing you learned?
Absolutely making sure you plan goals/issues ahead of time and making sure not to forget to turn in everything.

* What was your role / which stories did you work on
I was primarily responsible for fetching Pokémon data from the PokeAPI and integrating into the app. My contributions included developing the Explore Pokémon page, which dynamically retrieves and display a random set of Pokémon, which allows users to discover new Pokémon each time they visit. I also implemented the Search Pokemon page, enabling users to look up specific Pokémon by name and view their relevant details. Additionally, I created the Pokemon Details page, which provides and in depth view of each pokemon, including their stats, abilities, and type information. I also created a simple start page layout that allows routing to these different pages.
* What was the biggest challenge? 
Handling API requests efficiently while preventing performance issues.
* Why was it a challenge?
Navigation in expo-router needed proper parameter handling.
* How was the challenge addressed?
Used React Native navigation to pass parameters between pages.
* Favorite / most interesting part of this project
Successfully integrating Pokémon API data and making it visually appear in the application.
* If you could do it over, what would you change?
I would probably create a mock project layout, before even getting started.
* What is the most valuable thing you learned?
How to organize and divide your project effectively to be as efficient as possible.

* What was your role / which stories did you work on
I helped initialize the database and the user table for the user sign in. Along with that I created the team page and was working on getting the party feature running.
* What was the biggest challenge? 
Making any changes to the database at all
* Why was it a challenge?
For a large portion of the project I was having issues with the database not responding to any changes I had made no matter how many times I had reloaded the app. 
* How was this challenge addressed?
I wiped the data from the phone emulator which updated the tables.
* Favorite part of the project
Getting the party page to load the pokemon stats
* If you could do it over, what would you change?
I would spend more time trying different things and trying to understand react native better.
* What is the most valuable thing you learned
To start early and reach out for help

* What was your role / which stories did you work on
I was responsible for setting up the login page and connecting it with the database. My contributions included developing a login page, which retrieves the beginner set of Pokémon from an api call. I made the login redirect to the main page along with the sign up page redirect. 
* What was the biggest challenge? 
Working with github.
* Why was it a challenge?
Merge conflicts did not allow me to commit / delay my code.
* How was the challenge addressed?
Visited TA hours / instructor for extra help.
* Favorite / most interesting part of this project
Seeing my teammates work around my issues, and how a fresh set of eyes can help solve issues.
* If you could do it over, what would you change?
Learn to use github, and solve issues earlier.
* What is the most valuable thing you learned?
How important flow within a project is especially when you have certain areas waiting on key features that are not yet built.


## Conclusion
* How successful was the project?
Overall the project was a success in terms of creating a React Native app utilizing the PokeApi.
* What was the largest victory?
I think the largest victories were the explore and search pokemon screens. They came out great and made effective use of the PokeApi. 
* Final assessment of the project
Overall I think the project was successful, though there were features that we would have liked to have implemented further.
